# Stannia
This is a GitHub organization started by [@Nozemi](https://github.com/Nozemi) in an effort to build convenient tools, libraries, and plugins for Minecraft servers. The goal is to create as much open source as we can.

Biggest project is probably the ongoing _(currently closed-source)_ plugin library written in Kotlin, aiming to bring Kotlin closer to development of Minecraft servers.
